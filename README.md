# Scala Play [giter8](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8) Template.

This template provides a project setup for: 
 - A compilable and runnable compile time DI Play project
 - A healtcheck endpoint
 - A basic view template
 - Code formatting with Scalariform
 - An example test for the healthcheck endpoint
 - A working logback.xml file integrated with the application.

To use, ensure you have SBT 0.13.13 or higher, or G8

Then:

```
sbt new LA-Taylor-guardian/scala-play.g8
```

You will be asked to fill out some properties required for correctly building your project.

Once done, move to your new project and it should compile and run. Now you can begin customising for your specific projects needs and get started!
